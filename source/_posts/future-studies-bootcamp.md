Now I am ready for the advanced program of the makeitreal bootcamp. Because I have finished the full stack web developer bootcamp it is an option to study an advanced full time program with a senior developer. This could be a goal for 2019. Check out the programs maybe you can do one this year, I recommend the program I finished last year.

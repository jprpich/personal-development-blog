What works for me!

This Blog contains information about the personal development videos, writers, programs and other things out there that have worked for me and I currently still use to this day.

My name is Joshua Prpich. I have found that there is so much information out there that it can be hard to sift through. Since I am a personal development ( and software development ) geek I go through tons of personal development stuff and now I want to write down for myself and for anyone out there interested the best stuff I have found.

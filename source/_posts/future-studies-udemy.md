{% blockquote Mark Twain %}
"I have never let my schooling interfere with my education."
{% endblockquote %}

Following Mark Twain's advice to keep on studying every day and not conform to only what you learn in traditional education and because I have finished Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp I am going to start Udemy's Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp. I will be practicing React 16, Redux, D3, ES2015, Testing, CSS Flexbox, Animations, SVG, AJAX, and more. 

Check it out! If you want to learn with me this is a recommended plan for 2018!
